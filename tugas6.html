        <h2>The Vampire Diaries featured countless songs and artists throughout the series, but which songs on the show were the best for fans?</h2>
        <p class="penulis">written by <a href="#">Sasalvatore</a></p>
        <p>
          One of the reasons The Vampire Diaries remains a beloved show is the music that was featured throughout the series. Although at times too literal for what was happening on screen, the songs on the show beautifully accentuated the actions and emotions of the show's characters.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether it be an emotional ballad or an upbeat pop song, the music present throughout the series was selected with care and chosen to enhance the stories being told. Of all of the music that is incorporated throughout the series, these are some of the best songs that are the most memorable to fans.

          <td>"Gravity" by Sara Bareilles</td>
          <td>
            Sara Bareilles is an artist that is featured prominently throughout the series. "Gravity" appears in the second episode of the first season when Elena comes to see Stefan to resolve a tense moment between them that occurred earlier in the episode.
            <br>
            The music plays softly in the background as the two discuss Elena's worry about taking emotional risks with Stefan. As Elena and Stefan share their first kiss, "Gravity" reaches a crescendo and becomes the couple's defining song that cements Stefan and Elena's relationship in the first season.

          <td>"Never Let Me Go" by Florence + the Machine</td>
          <td>
            Florence + the Machine is a band that was featured multiple times throughout the series. Among their many songs, "Never Let Me Go" stands out as the most memorable to be included on the show. As the song's lyrics and melody evoke a romantic mood, it is a perfect complement to a key intimate moment between Damon and Elena.
            <br>
            The song starts quietly at first and grows louder when Elena kisses Damon while they are on a trip to get Jeremy. It is a huge moment for fans of the relationship. The lyrics "I'm not giving up, I'm just giving in" mirror Elena falling for Damon in season three. She can't help her emotional connection to the bad boy vampire and this song really highlights her complicated emotions towards him.

          <td>"Feel So Close" by Calvin Harris</td>
          <td>
            When Elena becomes a vampire, Damon gets her to let loose and have some fun. "Feel So Close" plays as Damon and Elena dance at a Halloween party on campus after feeding on some of the other party attendees. It is a slightly forbidden scene charged with danger and sensuality because the dance occurs while Elena was still with Stefan.
            <br>
            It isn't a typical song to play during a Damon and Elena scene as it is an upbeat and happy tune rather than an indie ballad or soft pop song. This is an important scene because Elena momentarily embraces being a vampire, which will become a major storyline for the remainder of the series. The song's fast rhythm compliments her carefree attitude and happiness in this scene and hints at the dark path she will eventually travel in later seasons.

          <td>"Hold On" by Chord Overstreet</td>
          <td>
            Chord Overstreet's "Hold On" was included in the finale of the show as Elena wakes up from the magical coma Kai put her in. It makes her reunions with the rest of the characters even more emotional and heartwarming. The lyrics fit perfectly for all of the characters getting the happy endings they deserve.
            <br>
            It is especially tear-jerking when Elena gets reunited with her family in heaven and Damon gets to find peace with Stefan as well. Fans can feel a sense of closure with this song, making it one of many perfect songs to end the series with.

          <td>"All I Need" by Within Temptation</td>
          <td>
            Unlike some other songs featured throughout the show, "All I Need" was not widely popular outside of The Vampire Diaries fandom. It isn't a pop hit like Calvin Harris's "Feel So Close"; instead, it's an indie emotional song about being completely in love with someone. In the first season, it makes Damon and Elena dancing to this song a huge moment since Elena is with Stefan.
            <br>
            Later on in the series, we learn that the first time Elena admitted how attracted she was to Damon was dancing along to this song at the Miss Mystic Falls pageant. It is understandable why she felt drawn to him considering the lyrics are so passionate. The significance of the Damon and Elena dance within the show's mythology cements this as one of the best and most important songs featured in the show.
